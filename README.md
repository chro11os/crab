Crab is a simple, lightweight, and high-performance web server built entirely in Rust. It leverages Rust's powerful features for safety, concurrency, and speed to provide a reliable foundation for web applications. The name "Crab" is a playful nod to Rust's mascot, Ferris the crab.

* **High Performance:** Built on top of Tokio for asynchronous I/O, allowing it to handle thousands of concurrent connections with minimal overhead.
* **Memory Safe:** Written in Rust, which guarantees memory safety and thread safety, eliminating many common bugs and security vulnerabilities at compile-time.
* **Lightweight:** A minimal core that is fast to build and deploy.
* **Extensible:** Designed with a simple architecture to make adding new functionality straightforward.
* **Cross-Platform:** Runs on any platform supported by Rust, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.
